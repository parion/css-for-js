# Character Creation Workshop

In this workshop, you'll build a Sims-style character creation screen.


## Mockups

Desktop:

For this workshop, we're only targeting desktops (although if you're so inclined, creating a mobile variant would make a great stretch goal!).

> Protip: If you're reading this in VS Code, open the Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P) and select “Markdown: Open Preview to the Side”. That way, you can see all the images in this document!

## Setup Instructions

This project uses create-react-app.

Start by installing dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Boot up a dev server:

```
npm run start
```

You should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project structure and context

This project is built with React.

**All of the functionality has already been built.** Your job is to add the CSS. Some light tweaking of the JSX will be required, but only in service of styling and accessibility goals.

This project uses **CSS Modules**. CSS modules are ultimately very similar to vanilla CSS, but the classes are applied in JS. Here's an example:

```css
/* Something.module.css */
.wrapper {
  width: 500px;
}
```

```js
/* Something.js */
import styles from './Something.module.css';

function Something() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.wrapper}>
      I'll be 500px wide!
    </div>
  );
}
```

Additionally, a few global styles can be found in `src/index.css`.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Fix footer links

Let's start with a small detail: The footer links are unreadable:

<img alt="Side-by-side comparison of the current footer vs. the ideal one" src="./docs/footer-fix.png" style="max-width: 500px" />

### Exercise 2: Layout adjustments

Next, let's tackle the biggest visual issue: the layout.

We have a `MaxWidthWrapper` constraining the max width, but everything is super wide within it.

Our header should be 65% of the available width, and our control-panel column should be 50%.

<img alt="Annotated mockup showing the overall width at 1024px, the header occupying 65%, and the control panels occupying 50%" src="./docs/sizes.png" style="width: 100%;" />

The character (the big illustration) should use fixed positioning, and it should occupy the space cleared by the above width tweaks.

Give the character a minimum height of 500px. On smaller windows, this means the character won't fit in the viewport:

<img alt="Screenshot of a shorter Chrome window, with the character truncated at the knees" src="./docs/short-window.png" style="width: 100%;" />

### Exercise 3: Overflow

Each control panel features a number of customizations. For control panels with too many options, a horizontal scrollbar should be introduced:

<img alt="Close-up screen recording of the overflow area in the control-panel" src="./docs/overflow.gif" style="width: 100%;" />

### Exercise 4: Perspective decoration

To help add a bit of perspective, a light gray bar should extend across the bottom 40% of the screen:

<img alt="Screenshot of the mockup, showing the light gray bar" src="./docs/mockup.png" style="width: 100%;" />

It should sit behind the avatar (and both the perspective bar and the character should sit below the footer):

<img alt="Screen recording, showing how the character and stripe don't move as the page is scrolled" src="./docs/scroll.gif" style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%" />

You can use the background color `hsl(195deg, 20%, 86%)`.

For bonus points, solve this challenge without setting any z-indexes.

### Exercise 5 (Stretch): Implement a mobile variant

On mobile devices, the cards should stack horizontally, and sit near the bottom of the screen, underneath the character:

<img alt="Screen recording, showing a mobile variant of the application" src="./docs/mobile-variant.gif" style="max-width: 100%" />

**NOTE:** This is a challenging stretch goal! It may require some CSS features we haven't covered yet. This is meant as an extra challenge for advanced students. Feel free to skip it!
